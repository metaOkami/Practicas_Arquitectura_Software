# Software Architecture Project
Proyect where I practice and improve with the logic and implementation of design patterns and SOLID methods. This is a work in progress project. 

# Implemented desing patterns
Commander
______________________________________________
I was so interested on this pattern because of it's behaviour as a replayer of last movements. Aside of that, on the project is used for the act to do
ctrl + z on the play you just did. I plan to scale this code to do a repetition viewer system and also to do it more scalable.


Observer
______________________________________________
I already have used Observer command for minimaps and now, on that project the place where you have to put the box it's the observer and the box the observable.
I did that thinking on the possibility of add more boxes to the puzzle.


_______________________________________________
I also includes Singleton to the "finish place" to make sure of there is only one instance of that object at the scene.
